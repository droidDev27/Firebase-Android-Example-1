Firebase-Android-Example
------------------------

Firebase Android Example provides a simple example on how to store your data in Firebase from Android.

Be sure to include internet permissions in your manifest file. Then pushing and retrieving data from your Firebase URL is simple using RESTful get and put requests. 

*See FirebaseAndroidExampleActivity.java to change the URLs to your Firebase location 

In this example we "http put and get" data into a leaderboard in a Firebase URL under YourFirebaseURL/Winners.

Check out Firebase's website for how to use the scalable backend. http://www.firebase.com/
